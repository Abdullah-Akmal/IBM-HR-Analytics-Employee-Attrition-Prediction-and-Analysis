## Objectives  
- Explore HR data to understand factors contributing to employee attrition  
- Build predictive models to classify high attrition risk employees  
- Support HR decision-making with data-driven insights  
- Evaluate model effectiveness using key metrics  

## Methodology / Steps  
- Load and explore the HR dataset  
- Conduct EDA with correlation plots and feature analysis  
- Encode categorical features and scale numeric values  
- Train models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest  
- Assess model performance with confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and classification report  
- Interpret key drivers of employee attrition  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
Python, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, StandardScaler, classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score)
